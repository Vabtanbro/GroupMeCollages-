# GroupMeets: Automating Group Allocation and Networking for College Students

## Introduction

Welcome to our Group Allocation and facilitating networking among college students!  We understand the challenges students face when joining college, particularly the uncertainty surrounding which groups to join and how to effectively collaborate. Our platform addresses these challenges by automating the group allocation process and providing easy access to student information, enabling seamless networking and communication among students.

## Key Challenges Addressed

- **Uncertainty in Group Selection**: Many students struggle with deciding which groups or clubs to join upon entering college, leading to indecision and missed opportunities for social and academic engagement.

- **Difficulty in Communication**: Without a centralized platform for accessing student information, students may find it challenging to connect with their peers, hindering networking and collaboration opportunities.




## How It Helps

1. **Automated Group Allocation**: Our platform alleviates the burden of group selection by automatically allocating students into compatible teams based on shared interests, skills, and academic objectives. This ensures that students are placed in groups where they can thrive and contribute effectively.

2. **Enhanced Collaboration**: By facilitating dynamic group allocation, our platform promotes collaboration among students from diverse backgrounds and disciplines. This fosters a supportive learning environment where students can exchange ideas, learn from each other, and develop valuable teamwork skills.

3. **Seamless Assessment Submission**: In addition to group allocation, our platform streamlines assessment submission, making it easy for students to submit their work hassle-free. This eliminates the need for manual submission methods and ensures that assessments are submitted efficiently, allowing students to focus on their academic goals.

## Getting Started

To get started with our platform, college administrators first need to upload a list of students and their class information. The format of the uploaded file should be as follows:

```
uid,name,class_section,year,
421040,Chirag Sen,233,2021,
509660,Tiya Borah,685,2021,
968154,Krish Karpe,632,2023,
323745,Biju Bedi,268,2024,
611124,Nitara Vasa,311,2021,
344438,Zoya Subramaniam,643,2022,
765443,Kismat Barad,801,2023,
285148,Nishith Iyer,365,2023,
```

Once the student information is uploaded, students can then ask the GroupMe chatbot about their section, and they will be provided with the relevant information along with links to join relevant groups.
## Benefits

Everything they need is available at their fingertips through the GroupMe chatbot, saving time and effort.
